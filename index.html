<H1>Shimano Road Groupsets Explained</H1>

<H3>Dura-Ace</H3>
<br>
<center><p>Dura-Ace is Shimano's top of the line components which is targeted at pro racers that go to take on the tour de france.
    These components have been designed to be as light as possible by being made of high quality carbon-fiber and titanium 
all to help keep the weight down. They have also been designed to be as aerodinamic as possible to help save on watts needed 
to go fast and keep top speed. These components are premium and typically stay over the thousand dollar mark because of all 
the features it has. The chain is actually hollow to save weight and is coated with premium material to keep chain wear down. 
The cassette also has special grooves to improove on shifting performance. </p></center>

<H3>Ultegra</H3>
<center><p>Shimano ultegra comes next to Dura-ace but is targeted at normal people. The components are nearly identical with the weight being 
    heavier especially on the disc brakes that weight alot more than Dura-ace but also lack extra cooling fins needed to keep the 
    temperature low to have consistent braking performance.
